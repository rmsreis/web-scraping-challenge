Mission-to-Mars
In this assignment, I used BeautifulSoup to scrape data from several websites containing Mars news. 
Data includes headlines with the latest Mars news, images of Mars, tweets about the Mars weather and a table of Mars facts. 
After scraping the data, I stored the data in MongoDB and then loaded it into an HTML file using a Flask/Jinja template that interfaces with Python. 
Finally, I formatted the HTML using Bootstrap and configured the app such that clicking a button on the webpage would re-scrape and load the data.

Prerequisites
The Python libraries flask, flask_pymongo, BeautifulSoup, and splinter must be installed in order for the code to run. The initial data scraping can be run either in a Jupyter Notebook or in Python.
